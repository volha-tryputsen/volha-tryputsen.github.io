### I love [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)!  
If there is an opportunity to create a shiny app, I make sure it lands in my backyard. I recently developed several complex shiny applications. Below are the latest two favorite of mine:  

* [Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) shiny application](GroupMyAbs_final.pdf) ( _GroupMyAbs_ ) – facilitates the use of state-of-the-art high throughput NGS data at early stages of large molecular drug discovery and enables antibody characterization in mathematically-driven manner, and as such decreases bias in decision making during the hit-to-lead stage of large molecular drug discovery. 

* Longitudinal data analysis shiny application ( _invivolda_ ) – allows streamlining complex statistical analyses for oncology in-vivo studies, conducted during early phases of drug discovery, taking efficient, multifaceted and reproducible approach.
